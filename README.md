# EPL21-22-analysis-portfolio-project
This is my personal project that i developed to leverage SQL language into data analysis, which analyzes the premier league season 2021/2022
The project injects data on kaggle, wikipedia, premier league website
All the queries shown was originated by myself without copying from any source
This shows nothing but how i use SQL queries to visualize the incredible insights that have been broken down in famous articles on the internet. So no new discovery or insights was made
